As the semester draws to a close and things get busier, we had the wonderful opportunity to visit a local high school to introduce our department and offer career guidance to students. 
Science and math have always been my favorite subjects, which inspired me to dream of becoming an engineer or scientist—someone who could use the knowledge I’ve gained to contribute meaningfully to the community. That small dream has grown over the years, helping shape the person I am today. However, this journey would not have been possible without the guidance and inspiration of the exceptional teachers and professors I’ve encountered along the way.

Having the chance to inspire the next generation in this way is truly one of the greatest blessings of being a professor!
