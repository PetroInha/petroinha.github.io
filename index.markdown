### <span style="color:#005BAC;">AI-Powered Subsurface Intelligence</span>

<span style="color:#005BAC;"><strong>Engineering the subsurface for a net-zero future.</strong></span>

At the Center for Unconventional Resources & Energy (CURE), we integrate:

- <span style="color:#005BAC;">Reservoir Physics & Simulation</span>  
- <span style="color:#005BAC;">Digital Rock & Multiscale Imaging</span>  
- <span style="color:#005BAC;">Generative AI & Uncertainty Quantification</span>  
- <span style="color:#005BAC;">CCS & Underground Hydrogen Storage</span>  

We do not just model reservoirs.  
<span style="color:#005BAC;"><strong>We build intelligent geoenergy systems for the energy transition.</strong></span>
