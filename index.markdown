# CURE Lab  
### AI-Powered Subsurface Intelligence

Engineering the subsurface for a net-zero future.

At the Center for Unconventional Resources & Energy (CURE), we integrate:

- Reservoir Physics & Simulation  
- Digital Rock & Multiscale Imaging  
- Generative AI & Uncertainty Quantification  
- CCS & Underground Hydrogen Storage  

We do not just model reservoirs.  
We build intelligent geoenergy systems for the energy transition.
