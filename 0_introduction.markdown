Welcome to the Center for Unconventional Resources and Energy (CURE), a visionary institution at the forefront of energy innovation. In a world grappling with escalating energy demands and the urgent need for sustainable solutions, our center stands as a beacon of progress, continuously pushing the boundaries of conventional thinking and delving into the vast potential of unconventional resources.

At CURE, we are acutely aware of the limitations and environmental challenges associated with traditional energy sources. Our mission is to spearhead a transformative shift in energy approaches by harnessing the untapped power of unconventional resources. Through pioneering research, advanced technologies, and strategic collaborations, we are dedicated to revolutionizing the way we generate and utilize energy.

In addition to our relentless pursuit of unconventional resources, we are passionately committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. To address this imperative, our research interests have expanded to include subsurface simulation and modeling for Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS). If you are eager to delve deeper into our work, we invite you to explore [our comprehensive research topics](), where we explore innovative strategies and technologies that are propelling us toward a sustainable and low-carbon future.
